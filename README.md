# redteam_project
This is a repo for the project here -> https://github.com/kurogai/100-redteam-projects <- 
All the script that i'll put here are simply the challenges.

I'm not a developper, i just want to improve my skills in python for my futur career in the redteam side of the cybersecurity.
Feel free if you have advice, i will try to post all the challenge (if i'm smart enough)
